# Optimal and robust control of Inverted Pendulum on a Cart (IPOC)
[Late Upload]

This repository presents a collection of MATLAB scripts and tools for the simulation and control of an inverted pendulum on a cart (IPOC) system. The IPOC is a widely studied benchmark problem in control theory due to its nonlinear and unstable dynamics. This project explores multiple control strategies including:

* **Pontryaginâ€™s Minimum Principle (PMP)**-based optimal control
* **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**
* **H-infinity (\$H\_\infty\$) loop shaping control** (single and double Riccati approach)

Simulation results compare the performance, stability, and robustness of these controllers. The goal is to evaluate the trade-offs between optimality and robustness in the presence of disturbances and system uncertainties.
